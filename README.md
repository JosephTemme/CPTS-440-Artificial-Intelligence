This project involved taking concepts learned in lecture on Artificially Intelligent Agents, Search, Logic, Planning, and Probabilistic Reasoning to create an intelligent agent that maneuvers around a 2D world in search of gold. It percieves its environment through percepts such as stenches (when the Wumpus monster is adjacent) or breezes (when a deadly Pit is adjacent). The adjacent is able to avoid deadly obstacles and find the gold while trying to maximize its score.
